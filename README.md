# slack-incident-help
This project will help you to create an incident using slack channel

I started this project folowing [this](https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/building-a-node-js-slack-bot-before-your-microwave-popcorn-is-ready-8946651a5071) steps to create my firs prototype. After I finished my firs prototype I used [this](https://github.com/colmdoyle/slack-incident-management) project as a code reference. 

Steps:
- run using `npm start`
- You have to configure a **slash command** `/incident` command with the **Request URL** like `https://your.app.domain/`
- You have to enable **Interactivity** with the **Request URL** like `https://your.app.domain/action`
